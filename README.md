# :books: Guidelines

I have learnt a lot reading from articles, code of others, meeting people and working with few of the superstars. Apart from this I try to mentor people in my spare time especially on Sunday and I see people are doing things wrong way just because of lack of proper guidence. They follow beginner tutorials and they tend to follow the same in the enterprise application. This guidence repo is a step towards solving this problem. 

## Guides
